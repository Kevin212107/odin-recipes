      <h1>Ingridients</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Chicken</strong>: This recipe starts with a 3-pound whole
          chicken. If your bird is larger or smaller, you'll need to adjust the
          recipe.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Seasonings</strong>: This roasted chicken is simply seasoned
          with salt, black pepper, and onion powder.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Butter</strong>: Butter locks in moisture and gives the
          seasonings something to adhere to.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Celery</strong>: Stuff the chicken cavity with celery for
          subtle vegetal flavor. Plus, the celery will release even more
          moisture as the chicken cooks.
        </li>
      </ul>
