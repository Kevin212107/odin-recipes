      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Meat</strong>: This lasagna recipe starts with a pound of
          ground meat (½ pound ground pork, ½ pound lean ground beef).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Onion</strong>: A diced onion is cooked until translucent with
          the ground meat.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Canned Tomatoes</strong>: You'll need a can of tomato sauce
          and a can of crushed tomatoes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Fresh Herbs</strong>: For fresh flavor, chop two tablespoons
          of parsley and crush one clove of garlic.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Sugar</strong>: A dash of sugar balances out all of the
          acidity from the tomatoes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Spices and seasonings</strong>: This homemade lasagna is
          seasoned with dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Noodles</strong>: Of course, you'll need lasagna noodles! This
          recipe calls for uncooked noodles, but you can use the oven-ready
          variety to save time.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Cheese</strong>: The cheese layer is made up of cottage cheese
          and Parmesan. You'll also need shredded mozzarella.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Eggs</strong>: Eggs make the cheese layer extra creamy. Plus,
          they act as a binding agent (which means they hold the layer
          together).
        </li>
      </ul>

    <div class="steps">
      <h1>Steps</h1>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Cook the meat</strong>: Cook the ground meat in a skillet
          until browned and crumbly. Add the onion and continue cooking until
          it's translucent. Stir in the canned tomato products, half of the
          parsley, garlic, basil, 1.5 teaspoons of salt, oregano, and sugar.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Cook the noodles</strong>: Boil the lasagna noodles in lightly
          salted water until they're al dente.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Make the cheese layer</strong>: Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan
          cheese, eggs, the remaining parsley, the remaining salt, and pepper in
          a bowl.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Assemble the lasagna</strong>: Layer the ingredients according
          to the recipe (starting with sauce and ending with mozzarella) until
          the lasagna is assembled.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Bake the lasagna</strong>: Cover with foil and bake in the
          preheated oven for about half an hour. Remove the foil and continue
          baking until the top is golden brown.
